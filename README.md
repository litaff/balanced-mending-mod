## Interaction with ingredients
The correct ingredient has to be in you inventory for mending to work. 
There is a 0.1% chance for the ingredient to be consumed when repairing.
When this happens you get a bonus to the amount repaired. 
Rarer ingredients give a higher bonus, which ranges from 2 to 64 times more durability repaired.
